# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction

The ultimate goal of this project is to predict whether a person is suffering from cardiovascular disease or not.
The WHO states that 17.9 million people die from CVD in 2016 which is 31% of the total deaths in the world. (Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), 2020) So From these facts and figures, we can easily conclude that Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the majority of death and hospitalization, health care expenditures, and loss of productivity in a developed country. With the help of data science, we will predict the possibility of a person having Cardiovascular disease based on various parameters specified in this dataset
Cardiovascular diseases are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and they include:
coronary heart disease – a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle.
cerebrovascular disease – a disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain.
peripheral arterial disease – a disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs.
rheumatic heart disease – damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria.
congenital heart disease – malformations of heart structure existing at birth.
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.
